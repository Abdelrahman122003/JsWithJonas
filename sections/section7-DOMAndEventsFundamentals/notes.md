## Definition of DOM

The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a webpage as a tree of objects, where each element (like a paragraph, heading, or button) is a node in this tree.

## DOM Manipulation

DOM manipulation refers to the process of using JavaScript (or another language) to interact with and change the content, structure, or style of the web page via the DOM. Common tasks include changing text, adding or removing elements, and updating styles. This makes the webpage dynamic and interactive.
